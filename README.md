# Fake E-Commerce

This is a completely fictitious project, and the API used is completely public, so do not use any real information in case of use.

A simple e-commerce example project for my portfolio. Built with ReactJs library, NextJS 13 framework and libraries like Tailwind Css, React Querty, React-hook-form, yup, gsap...

## Demo

The site is slow because my computer is very weak I couldn't finish showing the cart because the server restarted due to lack of memory, I spent 2 hours to record this video.
